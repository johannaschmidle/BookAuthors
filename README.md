## Motivation
This project is inspired by my love of reading. I wanted to explore a database of book sales information, with a particular focus on books released after the year 2000. More specifically, I was curious about author information (I wanted to see how my favourite authors are doing). I wanted get insights about an authors popularity, general rating, and sales trends. I used excel to perform a general cleaning of the database and then developed an interactive dashboard to present my findings. 
**Goal:** Gain insights into Author Popularity and Trends

## Task List
1. Clean Table (_Cleaned Table:_ [AuthorsProjectTable.csv](https://github.com/johannaschmidle/BookAuthors/blob/main/AuthorsProjectTable.csv))
2. Create interactive Excel dashboard ([AuthorsProject.xlsx](https://github.com/johannaschmidle/BookAuthors/blob/main/AuthorsProject.xlsx))
   
## Metrics and Dimensions
- **Average Book Rating:** The average rating given to the book by readers
- **Units Sold:** Total number of copies sold
- **Gross Sales:** The total sales revenue generated by each book
- **Publisher Revenue:** The revenue earned by publishers from selling each book
